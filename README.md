# Mike's [NixOS]  & [Home Manager] Configurations

[NixOS]: https://nixos.org/
[Home Manager]: https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager

This repository contains a [Nix Flake](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes) for configuring my computers and home environment. These are the computers this configuration currently manages:

|    Hostname    |       OEM      |        Model        |       OS      |   Role   |  Status  |
| :------------: | :------------: | :-----------------: | :-----------: | :----------: | :------- |
| `xps15`    | Dell XPS 15            | 9650            | NixOS         | Desktop      | Done     |

## Structure

- [home-manager]: Home Manager configurations
  - Sane defaults for shell and desktop
- [nixos]: NixOS configurations
  - Includes discrete hardware configurations which leverage the [NixOS Hardware modules](https://github.com/NixOS/nixos-hardware) via [flake.nix].
- [scripts]: Helper scripts

The [nixos/_mixins] and [home-manager/_mixins] are a collection of generic configurations that are composited based on the arguments defined in [flake.nix].

[home-manager]: ./home-manager
[nixos]: ./nixos
[nixos/_mixins]: ./nixos/_mixins
[home-manager/_mixins]: ./home-manager/_mixins
[flake.nix]: ./flake.nix
[scripts]: ./scripts

## Installing 💾

This is a work in progress 😅 I'm working towards making the installation entirely automated.

- Boot off a .iso image created by this flake using `rebuild-iso` (*see below*).
- Put the .iso image on a USB drive
- Boot the target computer from the USB drive
- Clone my nix-config

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wimpysworld/nix-config.git
```

- Run the install script 📜
 - The install script uses [Disko] to automatically partition and format the disks then uses my flake via `nixos-install` to complete a full system installation

```bash
cd nix-config
scripts/install.sh <hostname> <username>
```

- Make a cuppa 🫖
- Reboot

## Applying Changes ✨

I clone this repo to `~/Zero/nix-config`. Home Manager and NixOS changes can be applied separately because I am planning to add support for some non-NixOS hosts.

```bash
gh repo clone wimpysworld/nix-config ~/Zero/nix-config
```

### NixOS ❄️

A `rebuild-host` alias is provided, that does the following:

```bash
sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake $HOME/Zero/nix-config
```

### Home Manager 🏠️

A `rebuild-home` alias is provided, that does the following:

```bash
home-manager switch -b backup --flake $HOME/Zero/nix-config
```

### ISO 📀

A `rebuild-iso` alias is provided, that does the following:

```bash
pushd $HOME/Zero/nix-config
nix build .#nixosConfigurations.iso.config.system.build.isoImage
popd
```

A live image will be left in `~/$HOME/Zero/nix-config/result/iso/`

## What's in the box? 🎁

Nix is configured with [flake support](https://zero-to-nix.com/concepts/flakes) and the [unified CLI](https://zero-to-nix.com/concepts/nix#unified-cli) enabled.

### The Shell 🐚

[Fish shell] with [powerline-go](https://github.com/justjanne/powerline-go) and a collection of tools that deliver a somewhat *"[Modern Unix]"* experience. The base system has a firewall enabled and also includes [OpenSSH], [Tailscale], [Podman & Distrobox] and, of course, a delightfully configured [nano]. (*Fight me!* 🥊)

[Fish shell]: ./home-manager/_mixins/console/fish.nix
[Modern Unix]: ./home-manager/_mixins/console/default.nix
[OpenSSH]: ./nixos/_mixins/services/openssh.nix
[Tailscale]: ./nixos/_mixins/services/tailscale.nix
[Podman & Distrobox]: ./nixos/_mixins/boxes/podman.nix
[nano]: ./nixos/_mixins/base/nano.nix

### The Desktop 🖥️

MATE Desktop 🧉 and Pantheon 🏛️ are the two desktop options available. The [font configuration] is common with both desktops using [Work Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Work+Sans) and [Fira Code](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Fira+Code). The usual creature comforts you'd expect to find in a Linux Desktop are integrated such as [Pipewire], Bluetooth, [Avahi], [CUPS], [SANE] and [NetworkManager].

[font configuration]: ./nixos/_mixins/desktop/default.nix
[Pipewire]: ./nixos/_mixins/services/pipewire.nix
[Avahi]: ./nixos/_mixins/services/avahi.nix
[CUPS]: ./nixos/_mixins/services/cups.nix
[SANE]: ./nixos/_mixins/services/sane.nix
[NetworkManager]: ./nixos/_mixins/services/networkmanager.nix

## Inspirations 🧑‍🏫

Before preparing my NixOS and Home Manager configurations I took a look at what other Nix users are doing. My colleagues shared their configs and tips which included [nome from Luc Perkins], [nixos-config from Cole Helbling], [flake from Ana Hoverbear] and her [Declarative GNOME configuration with NixOS] blog post. A couple of friends also shared their configurations and here's [Jon Seager's nixos-config] and [Aaron Honeycutt's nix-configs].

While learning Nix I watched some talks/interviews with [Matthew Croughan](https://github.com/MatthewCroughan) and [Will Taylor's Nix tutorials on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-saUBvIJzOkjAw_vOac75v-x6EzNzZq-). [Will Taylor's dotfiles] are worth a look, as are his videos, and [Matthew Croughan's nixcfg] is also a useful reference. **After I created my initial flake I found [nix-starter-configs](https://github.com/Misterio77/nix-starter-configs) by [Gabriel Fontes](https://m7.rs) which is an excellent starting point**. I'll be incorporating many of the techniques it demonstrates in my nix-config.

I like the directory hierarchy in [Jon Seager's nixos-config] and the mixin pattern used in [Matthew Croughan's nixcfg], so my initial Nix configuration is heavily influenced by both of those. Ana's excellent [Declarative GNOME configuration with NixOS] blog post was essential to get a personalised desktop. That said, there's plenty to learn from browsing other people's Nix configurations, not least for discovering cool software. I recommend a search of [GitHub nixos configuration] from time to time to see what interesting techniques you pick up and new tools you might discover.
